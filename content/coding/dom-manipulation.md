When you are starting learning javascript I believe that one of the first things you will hear is about DOM Manipulation.  

Unless you are only using the console,  you will need some knowledge of to use javascript within the Dom. 

I don't want to focus to much in the theory as I learn more by doing and creating things, but let's define the DOM and what it means "manipulate it".

DOM stands for **Document Object Model** and works like a tree and in that tree there are all elements of the page. That tree has diferent relantioships(parent, children, sibling, etc) depending of their position.

If a tree is difficult to image, think about a family like they are the **parents**, so when they have a kid their kid is their **children** right? If they have another, that children is going to have a **sibling.** Makes sense? So are the parents the main parents of that family? Well it depends. If the parents are children of someone then, they are also children of someone and someone is the parent.

Saying that I mean that the parent element of them all is the HTML document. How you get there?

\`blackBoard\` is an element that we will going to create soon in the project
